# CHAP Training Examples Materials
This repositiory contains materials for introducing users to using [CHAP](https://github.com/CHESSComputing/ChessAnalysisPipeline) through a series of example use cases with increasing complexity.

Each `example_*` directory contains:
1. `environment.yaml` -- the appropriate conda environment configuration for the example.
1. `pipeline.yaml` -- the example CHAP pipeline.
1. `vizualize.ipynb` -- a notebook containing examples of how to visualize the output data of the example pipeline.
